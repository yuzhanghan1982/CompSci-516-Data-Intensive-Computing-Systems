###1 Hadoop
####Strength:
Fast batch processing with relatively low overhead ([1] pp. 5)

Allow data to be combined from multiple sources ([1] pp. 3)

Capable of processing petabytes of data ([1] pp. 5)

Dynamic schema ([1] pp. 5)

Graceful handling of partial failure ([1] pp. 7)

####Weakness:
Low intermediate integrity within jobs ([1] pp. 5) 

Deficient in Iterative jobs, Interactive analytics due to long setup time of jobs and tasks ([2])
