###37 Esper

####Strength:

Support complex event processing (CEP), can process series of complex events, SQL-like interface [1]

####Weakness:

Single-machine engine, no support for multi-core, sliding window cannot express some complicated stream computation [2]

###38 Storm

####Strength:

Distributed, real-time computation, simple programming model, easy to scale, java-based, in-memory [1]

####Weakness:

User must programmatically define analytic functions – descriptive query languages not support, CEP not natively supported [2]

###39 Muppet

####Strength:

MapReduce-style framework, work on a cluser for fast data

####Weakness:

On-disk, not on a CEP level [2]

###40 HBase

####Strength:

Scalable, fast update, user-defined embedded function, availability, column-oriented store easy for aggregation, rich set of data filters, light-weight compared to Cassandra and Impala, … [1]

####Weakness:

No support for complex analytics, no actual support for load balancing, Client interface support only few basic commands, not easy to control data distribution and table schema … [2]
